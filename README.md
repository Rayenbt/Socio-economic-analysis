# Socio-Economic Factors Across Income Groups (2000â€“2018)

This project explores key socio-economic indicators across countries grouped by income level (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income) between 2000 and 2018. It aims to uncover trends and disparities in health, demographics, inflation, and economic development.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Through data exploration and visualization, this analysis investigates:

- The relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy
- The impact of health investments on health outcomes
- Variations in birth rates and infant mortality across income groups
- Differences in inflation trends across country groups
- Demographic stability through birth and death rate trends

All insights are drawn from real-world data and presented with clear visual support.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `socio_analysis.R`: Main analysis notebook
- `Datasets/`: Raw datasets
- `Plots/`: Visualizations exported from the notebook

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- **GDP vs Life Expectancy:** Higher GDP per capita correlates with longer life expectancy.
- **Health Spending:** Generally improves outcomes, but not uniformly across all income levels.
- **Birth & Infant Mortality Rates:** Higher in low-income countries due to younger populations and weaker healthcare systems.
- **Inflation:** More volatile in lower-income countries.
- **Birth/Death Rates:** Gradual convergence across groups, with notable improvements in low-income countries.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- R
- R studio
- World bank datasets

## ðŸ“ˆ Visual Highlights

The notebook includes:

- Scatter plots (e.g., GDP vs Life Expectancy)
- Correlation heatmaps
- Bar charts grouped by income level
- Line plots tracking trends over time
